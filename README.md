# Hangman-Game
For the AP Computer Science Exam I worked to create the popular game Hangman, this projet was the culmination of a years worth of comp sci work, it was created using 
python -- the code is very sketch because I am a coding newbie.

I took inspiration from Coolmathgames Hangman game
I received help from my friends Logan, and Ben & my brother Connor(username: connormachado)
